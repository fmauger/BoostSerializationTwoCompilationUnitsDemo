## Introduction

This  set   of  sample   C++  files   illustrates  how   to  implement
serialization   functionalities,   through   the   Boost/Serialization
library,  in   several  (simple)  classes  defined   from  three  shared
libraries with dependency relationship.   The libraries  instantiate
dedicated templatized  code for  serialization of classes  for several
types  of Boost  archives  as well  as  class registration  (*export*)
mechanism                                                         (see
the [Boost/Serialization documentation](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/serialization/doc/index.html)
for details).

Two use cases are considered:

1)  Simple class  ``xy::Y``  with an  attribute  (composition) of  the
   simpler class  ``xy::X`` in the  first library (``libXY``).  Class  ``z::Z`` in
   the second  library (``libZ``) with a class  ``xy::Y`` attribute (composition)
   and  a  class  ``xy::X``  attribute (composition)  from  the  first
   library.

```
    +-----------------+
    |      xy::X      |
    +-----------------+
    | val : uint32_t  |
    +-----------------+

    +-----------------+
    |      xy::Y      |
    +-----------------+
    | x : xy::X       |
    +-----------------+
                        First shared lib (libXY)
    --------------------------------------------
                        Second shared lib (libZ)
    +-----------------+
    |      z::Z       |
    +-----------------+
    | y : xy::Y       |
    | x : xy::X       |
    +-----------------+
```

2) Class ``xy::B``  inherited from  polymorphic class  ``xy::A`` in  the first
   library (``libXY``); class  ``z::C`` in  the second  library (``libZ``) inherited  from class
   ``xy::B`` from the first library, class  ``plugin::P`` in  the third  library (``libPlugin``) inherited  from class
   ``xy::A`` from the first library.

```

    |    /xy::A/      |
    +-----------------+
    | val : uint32_t  |
    +-----------------+
    | /to_string/     |

    |    /xy::B/      |                            |

    | /to_string/     |                            |
    +-----------------+                            |
                                                   |

```

Various  test programs are provided to test (de)serialization.
The generated Boost archive files use the XML format.

This demo has been tested under Linux  but should work on any other OS
with a descent  C++ compiler and Boost/Serialization  installed on the
system.

A CMake script is provided to build the full chain of software (DLLs and test executable).

## Building the demo

From the source directory:

```sh
$ mkdir _build.d
$ cd _build.d
$ cmake [-DBOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost/installation] ..
$ make
$ make test
$ ls XY/ Z/ Plugin/
```

## Utilities

Shell scripts provided to build and test the code:

* ``utilities/build.sh``  : Build  binary  modules, shared  libraries and  test
  programs.

From the base source directory, run:

```sh
$ ./utilities/build.sh
```

 * ``utilities/run.sh`` : Run test  programs. Each executable produces
   an  XML  archive  file  which contains  serialized  object  of  the
   different classes implemented from both libraries.

   From the base source directory, run:

```sh
$ ./utilities/run.sh
```

 * ``utilities/clean.sh`` : Clean the working files (binaries, archive
   files).

   From the base source directory, run:

```sh
$ ./utilities/clean.sh
```
